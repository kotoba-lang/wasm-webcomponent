(ns kotoba.kami-host
  "A minimal, deterministic game-engine ECS host for the kami-* host
  imports (kotoba-core-contracts \"kami/engine\", capability id 233): the
  kami:engine vocabulary exposed through kotoba's single (module \"kotoba\")
  ABI, so a `.kotoba` guest can drive real game logic.

  PORTABLE (.cljc) per the repo-wide runtime priority (CLAUDE.md
  2026-07-07: kotoba wasm > clojurewasm > ClojureScript > nbb, JVM last
  resort). The guest is already kotoba wasm; this HOST's canonical
  non-JVM runtime is ClojureScript — the whole ECS core below is plain
  portable Clojure (atoms, sorted-map, double math, 32-bit-pair
  xorshift64), and the wire layer splits by platform:

    :cljs  `kami-host-imports` — a (module \"kotoba\") import object for
           the native `js/WebAssembly` engine (browser or Node/nbb; the
           JS API hands host functions real numbers and frounds f32
           returns, so no bit-unpacking is needed). Exercised by
           scripts/verify_kami_survivors_nbb.cljs (nbb, no JVM) and by
           kotoba-lang/wasm-webcomponent's shadow-cljs build.
    :clj   `kami-effects`/`kami-host-functions` — the Chicory wiring,
           kept ONLY so the existing kotoba.wasm-exec test suite
           (kami_game_test.clj) stays green; the JVM is the last-resort
           runtime here, not the premise.

  clojurewasm (`cljw`, the priority rung above ClojureScript) cannot host
  this yet: its current FFI surface is `wasm/load`+`wasm/call` for
  import-free modules — Clojure-provided host imports are explicitly the
  future \"fuller Phase-16 FFI surface\" (docs/examples/wasm/README.md,
  checked 2026-07-10), and this guest needs 12 host imports. Revisit when
  that lands.

  Same guest-computes/host-executes split as the gpu-set-position surface
  (ADR-2607078000): this host owns ALL entity state (id -> tag/position/
  velocity), the fixed-step Euler integration, the tick counter, the input
  axes, and a SEEDED xorshift64 random stream (deterministic replay — same
  seed, same game, on every runtime; never the OS RNG). The guest owns only
  per-tick decisions: the driver calls `step!` then the guest's 0-arg
  `main`, once per tick — no guest-side loop. Batch ops
  (move-tagged-toward!/despawn-within!) stand in for per-entity iteration
  the language deliberately doesn't have.

  One state map (see `fresh-state`) lives for one game run; on the JVM
  every wasm-facing op is guarded through
  kotoba.wasm-exec/guarded-host-functions (fail-closed, receipted)."

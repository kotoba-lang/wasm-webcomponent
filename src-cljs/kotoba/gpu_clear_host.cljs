(ns kotoba.gpu-clear-host
  "Track B Phase 0 spike (ADR-2607078000): the browser host for the
  `gpu-clear` capability — the first proof that a compiled `.kotoba` guest
  can drive a real WebGPU canvas clear through a genuinely SYNCHRONOUS
  Wasm host-import, with no JSPI / Atomics.wait bridge.

  The trick (not a workaround — this is how the WebGPU spec is actually
  shaped): `navigator.gpu.requestAdapter`/`adapter.requestDevice` are the
  ONLY async calls in this path, and they run once, host-side, BEFORE the
  guest ever executes (`setupGpuClearHost`, an async function the page
  awaits before instantiating the wasm module). Every per-frame WebGPU call
  after that — `device.createCommandEncoder`, `encoder.beginRenderPass`,
  `pass.end`, `device.queue.submit` — is synchronous per spec, so the
  `gpu_clear` host-import function itself never needs to `await` anything,
  which is the one thing a synchronous Wasm host-import fundamentally
  cannot do.

  Wire format: `gpu_clear(rgba8: i32) -> i32`. `rgba8` is a packed
  0xRRGGBBAA 32-bit color as the raw i32 bit pattern the guest passed
  (`kotoba-core-contracts`' `gpu-clear` capability) — unpacked here via
  `>>> 0` (reinterpret the signed i32 as unsigned) then byte-shifted into
  four 0.0-1.0 WebGPU clear-color channels.")

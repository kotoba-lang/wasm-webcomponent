(ns verify-llm-infer-browser
  "Real-browser (headless Chromium via Playwright) end-to-end verification
  that `llm-infer` works in an ACTUAL browser tab -- not just Node inject
  (`test/verify-http-post.mjs`'s inject-path coverage never exercised
  llm-infer at all) -- via the SAME SharedArrayBuffer+Atomics.wait bridge
  `http-post` already proved out (`test/browser/verify_http_post_browser.cljs`).

  `src/actor-host.js`'s `llm_infer` reuses the identical bridge shape as
  `http_post` (`opts.llmInferBridge` + `opts.llmInferUrl`, POSTing the raw
  prompt bytes and reading the raw completion text back) --
  `kotoba-wasm-worker-host.js` passes the SAME already-constructed bridge
  instance for both capabilities, so this is 'generalize/reuse the SAB
  bridge', not a second bridge implementation.

  This test's local server stands in for a developer-controlled LLM proxy
  (never a real LLM provider called directly from the browser with an
  embedded API key -- see kotoba-wasm-worker-host.js's namespace comment).

  Run from this repo's root: `npx nbb -cp test/browser
  test/browser/verify_llm_infer_browser.cljs`

  The guest fixture bakes the prompt string in at build time (unlike
  http-post's fixture, llm-infer's target URL is never guest-controlled --
  it comes from the host-supplied `llm-infer-url` attribute -- so nothing
  server-dependent needs to be baked into the WAT, and a checked-in
  approach would work too; generated fresh here anyway for consistency with
  the http-post fixture and to keep both e2e tests self-contained)."

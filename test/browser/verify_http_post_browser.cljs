(ns verify-http-post-browser
  "Real-browser (headless Chromium via Playwright) end-to-end verification
  that `http-post` works through the SharedArrayBuffer+Atomics.wait bridge
  (`src/http-post-bridge.js`'s `createSabHttpPostBridge`, wired into
  `src/actor-host.js`'s `http_post` via `opts.httpPostBridge`) in an
  ACTUAL cross-origin-isolated browser tab -- not Node's own WebAssembly
  engine (`test/verify-http-post.mjs` already covers the inject path that
  way) and not just the bridge primitive in isolation. This is the one gap
  both `main`'s merged http-post implementation and the (closed, superseded)
  PR #6 left open: a real `.kotoba`-shaped WASM guest, instantiated inside a
  dedicated Worker (`kotoba-wasm-worker-host.js`, via
  `kotoba-wasm-worker-element.js`'s `<worker-http-post-demo>` custom
  element -- see `examples/actor-host/index.html`), actually completing a
  real HTTP POST round-trip against a real local server, on a page served
  with real COOP/COEP headers.

  Run from this repo's root: `npx nbb -cp test/browser
  test/browser/verify_http_post_browser.cljs`

  The guest fixture is generated fresh each run (a small WAT template with
  the local echo server's OS-assigned port baked in, compiled via the
  `wasm-tools` CLI -- the same 'assemble a WAT fixture into real Wasm bytes
  at test time' technique `kototama.tender-test` (JVM) already uses) rather
  than a checked-in `.wasm`, since the target URL's port isn't known until
  the echo server is actually listening.

  This test drove two real, previously-latent bugs to ground (both fixed
  alongside it, not just worked around):
  1. `http-post-bridge.js`'s inner Worker decoded the URL via
     `new TextDecoder().decode(payload.subarray(...))` -- a view directly
     over a `SharedArrayBuffer`, which `TextDecoder.decode` refuses
     ('The provided ArrayBufferView value must not be shared', confirmed
     live). Fixed to `.slice(...)` (copies into a fresh, non-shared
     buffer) in the same commit as this test.
  2. `createSabHttpPostBridge` spawns its own inner Worker and returns
     before that Worker has actually started (Worker instantiation is
     async) -- calling `postSync` immediately is a real, confirmed-live
     deadlock. `kotoba-wasm-worker-host.js` documents and works around this
     with a short yield; see its own comment."

(defn- start-echo-server
  "A real local HTTP server that echoes `ECHO:<url>:<body>` -- the guest's
  `http_post` call target. Deliberately a DIFFERENT origin than the static
  server (different port), so this also exercises the real cross-origin
  path a guest's `http_post` normally hits: `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy:
  require-corp` on the page (needed for `SharedArrayBuffer`) requires a
  cross-origin fetch response to carry `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy:
  cross-origin`, and the bridge's non-simple `content-type:
  application/octet-stream` POST triggers a CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) that
  needs its own `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`/`-Headers` response --
  confirmed live: omitting either one made `http_post` fail closed (fast,
  not a hang) with no real request ever reaching this handler. Returns a
  Promise of `{:baseUrl :close}`."

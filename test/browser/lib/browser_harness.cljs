  "General-purpose (non-WebGPU) real-Chromium test harness for this repo's
  zero-build-step ES modules, run via nbb -- CLAUDE.md: new Node-side
  test/verification harnesses are written in nbb, not .mjs/.cjs. Ports the
  static-server + full-Chromium-launch technique
  test/render/lib/webgpu-harness.mjs established (ADR-2607078000 Addendum
  8, later ported to nbb in kotoba-lang/kami-app-amenominaka's
  test/render/lib/webgpu_harness.cljs) -- the *technique* is reused per
  that precedent, this is an independent (smaller) port, not a require of
  either existing file: actor-host.js exercises WASM host imports
  (crypto/clock/storage/network), not GPU, so there's no
  navigator.gpu/full-Chromium-build concern here, and no screenshot
  helper."

  synchronously, then populates it once WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming +
  the guest call resolve -- polling current DOM state, not listening for a
  `kotoba-wasm:done` event, so this is race-free regardless of whether
  that already happened by the time this runs), then return it.

  `selector` is baked directly into the evaluated source (via
  `JSON.stringify`, so it's safely quoted) rather than passed as a
  separate Playwright `arg` -- Playwright only applies `arg` when
  `pageFunction` is a real Function value, not when it's a source string,
  so a string `pageFunction` given an `arg` silently ignores it. BOTH the
  `.waitForFunction` predicate below AND the final `.evaluate` call are an
  explicit IIFE (`(() => ...)()`), not a bare arrow-function string: passed
  as-is, `page.evaluate`/`page.waitForFunction` treat a string as an
  *expression* to evaluate, and a bare `\"() => ...\"` expression evaluates
  to a function VALUE (never actually CALLED) rather than the predicate's
  actual result -- for `.evaluate` this is unserializable and silently
  drops to `undefined` (confirmed by a real crash this caused: `.includes`
  called on the resulting `undefined`); for `.waitForFunction` it's WORSE
  and silent, not a crash: a function value is always truthy, so the
  'condition' is satisfied on the very first poll regardless of the actual
  DOM state, and `wait-for-shadow-text` returns immediately with
  WHATEVER `pre.textContent` happens to be at that instant (often still
  empty) -- confirmed live: this masked itself in the first consumer of
  this helper (fast, main-thread-only guests, already done by the time
  polling starts) and only surfaced once a slower, Worker-hosted guest
  needed this same helper to actually wait."
